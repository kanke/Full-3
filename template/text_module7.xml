"Etireno" is a feature film that is based on true events that follow the paths of the slave traders and their captives as they scheme their way across Benin with the Red Cross hot on their heals. Bringing in elements from The Royal Navy and following the British Diplomats as they attempt to intervene using powers granted to them from the UN this story is a heart wrenching story of humanity and survival.

This feature has been developed as a charity feature film in conjunction with Antislavery International and its sole purpose is to raise the much-needed funds to educate and eradicate slavery from around the world.
