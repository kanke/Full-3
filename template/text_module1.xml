<text><![CDATA[Adamantine Pictures Ltd is a privately owned British Film and Television Company, based in Hampstead, London. The company was originally established in 2007 as a Feature Film Development Company.  After spending six years creating a variety of high quality features that span the majority of genres, Adamantine Pictures has taken the decision to change direction to become an Independent Production Company. Its primary aim now is to produce exceptional feature films for the international market.
Currently in development is a wide range of projects within different genres from a low budget £1m Mystery Thriller, to a larger £30m epic style adventure.
